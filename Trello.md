We're using this to track progress and stay organized in general. Let me know if you have any questions or issues.

## How to use
- Right click on a card and click "Open Card" to view the checklist if the card has one
- Cards are sorted from top to bottom by importance.
- Orange cards are for Charles Game Dev
- Blue cards are for artists
- Green cards are for audio (music/sfx)
- Pink cards are for people in general.
